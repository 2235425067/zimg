zimg
==========

A light image storage and processing system. <br />
It's entirely written by C. <br />
zimg has high performance in image field. More infomation: [Benchmark](http://zimg.buaa.us/benchmark.html) <br />
It's designed for high concurrency image server. <br />

### dependence:
[libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent): Provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO. <br />
[imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php): A software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. <br />
[memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached): A distributed memory object caching system. <br />

### supplying:
storage users' upload images. <br />
get image through HTTP protocol. <br />
return resized image by request parameter. <br />
use memcached to improve performance. <br />

### in planning:
distributed architecture. <br />
performance optimization. <br />
security measures. <br />
