#zimg#


zimg ([Homepage](http://zimg.buaa.us/)) is a light image storage and processing system. It's written by C and it has high performance in image field. There is a benchmark test report with more infomation: [Benchmark](http://zimg.buaa.us/benchmark.html). zimg is designed for high concurrency image server. It supports many features for uploading and downloading images.

### Dependence:
> We stand on the shoulders of giants.  

[libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent): Provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO.  
[libevhtp](https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp): A more flexible replacement for libevent's httpd API.  
[imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php): A software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images.  
[memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached): A distributed memory object caching system.  
[lua](http://www.lua.org/): Lua is a lightweight multi-paradigm programming language designed as a scripting language with extensible semantics as a primary goal.  
#### [Optional] For beansdb backend:  
[beansdb](https://github.com/douban/beansdb): Beansdb is a distributed key-value storage system designed for large scale online system, aiming for high avaliablility and easy management.  
[beanseye](https://github.com/douban/beanseye): Beanseye is proxy and monitor for beansdb, written in Go.  
#### [Optional] For ssdb backend:  
[hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis): Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.  
[ssdb](https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb): SSDB is a high performace key-value(key-string, key-zset, key-hashmap) NoSQL database, an alternative to Redis.  


### Supplying:
Receive and storage users' upload images.  
Transfer image through HTTP protocol.  
Process resized and grayed image by request parameter.  
Use memcached to improve performance.  
Multi-thread support for multi-core processor server.  
Use lua for conf and other functions.  
Support SSDB mode to save images and backups.  
**Support beansdb mode to save images into distributed storage backend.**

### In Planning:
Performance optimization.  
Security measures.  

### Documentation:
There is an architecture design document of zimg v1.0.  
It is written in Chinese.  
[Architecture Design of zimg](http://zimg.buaa.us/arch_design.html)  
And this document is to introduce zimg v2.0.
